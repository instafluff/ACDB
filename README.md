# ACDB
The Comfiest Animal Crossing Database API!

This Animal Crossing API combines data from the [ACNH API data](https://github.com/alexislours/ACNHAPI) with [Nookipedia Wiki](https://nookipedia.com/wiki/) info into an easy summary JSON API

**Villager info**
Open [https://www.instafluff.tv/ACDB/Villagers/Name.json](https://www.instafluff.tv/ACDB/Villagers/Name.json) and replace `Name.json` with the villager's name that you wish to look up (e.g. For "Filbert", [https://www.instafluff.tv/ACDB/Villagers/Filbert.json](https://www.instafluff.tv/ACDB/Villagers/Filbert.json))!

## Using The ACDB ChatBlocks

To add the Twitch chat commands `!saying [option name]` and `!villager [name]` to your stream, download the [ACDB.cbs file](https://www.instafluff.tv/ACDB/ACDB.cbs) and drag-and-drop it into ChatBlocks at [https://www.instafluff.tv/ChatBlocks](https://www.instafluff.tv/ChatBlocks) and press Run!
