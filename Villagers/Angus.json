He debuted in Doubutsu no Mori e+, appearing as one of six starter cards bundled with the game, alongside Walker, Maggie, Rod, Merry, and Willow, respectively. His name derives from the \"Aberdeen Angus\" breed of cow, hence his Scottish catchphrase. It may also be derived from \"angus beef\", a brand of cow beef."}
