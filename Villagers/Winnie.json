She was absent from Animal Crossing: Wild World and returns in Animal Crossing: City Folk. Her name is a reference to whinnying, an onomatopoeia for the sound a horse makes, and the given name Winnie. Her catchphrase is a combination of the words \"hay\" and \"A-OK.\" She can be seen in the cover of Animal Crossing: City Folk under a tree reading a book."}
