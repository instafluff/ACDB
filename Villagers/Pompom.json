Her name is derived from \"pom-pom,\" a ball of fibers wielded by cheerleaders during sports, alongside her initial phrase \"rah rah\" - \"rah rah\" is a popular cheerleading chant. Many peppy villagers aspire to become cheerleaders, so it is likely her name and initial phrase make direct relation to the peppy personality."}
