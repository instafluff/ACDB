His name reflects on the cartoon name given to dogs, usually meaning muscular in appearance. His Rottweiler appearance may also relate to this, as they too appear masculine and muscular. His initial phrase, \"ROOOOOWF\", is an amalgam of \"woof\" and \"ruff\". He is also the only dog with a cranky personality in all games except Doubutsu no Mori e+, where Champagne appears as well. He shares his Wild World picture quote with Curt, another villager."}
