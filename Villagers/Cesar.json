He has appeared in every Animal Crossing series game so far. His English name is an allusion to the Roman dictator Julius Caesar, hence the catchphrase \"highness\", which reflects his sense of self-importance and kingly status. Him being an gorilla is also a likely reference to the character Caesar, the patriarch of a colony of sentient apes, from the Planet of the Apes film franchise. He had a minor role in 🎬 Gekijōban Doubutsu no Mori, where he was friends with Cyrano the anteater, another cranky villager."}
