She has been in all of the Animal Crossing games. Her name is derived from \"bunny\", an alternative, childish name for a rabbit. Her Japanese name may refer to knitting spools (commonly known as ririyan (Lily yarn) in Japan) which often come in a rabbit-like \"Y\" shape. She appears on the back of the case of the Animal Crossing: City Folk right by the 'Meet the neighbors' paragraph."}
