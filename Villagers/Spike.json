His name refers to the horn on his head, which could also be called a spike. Following his debut in Doubutsu no Mori, Spike would remain absent in all games past Doubutsu no Mori e+, before making a return in Animal Crossing: New Leaf - Welcome amiibo. Previously, however, Spike would have returned in Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer, but was ultimately unused. Unused data of Spike could also be found in Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp prior to his inclusion in the game."}
