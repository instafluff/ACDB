Her name relates to her large, circled eyes and area of her ears, though it could also be a reference to the word \"dotty\", which means \"small\", hence her catchphrase \"wee one\". \"Dotty\" can also mean \"eccentric\", and to be \"dotty\" about something means to like, love, or show a great interest in something or someone. Both of these fit with the airheaded, yet positive nature of peppy villagers."}
