He first appeared in Animal Crossing: New Leaf. His name comes from the word Disk Jockey, or DJ, for short. His English name may also come from Jacques Cousteau, an oceanographer who also wore a beanie. His catchphrase is French for \"darn it,\" referencing his name, the French counterpart for Jack."}
