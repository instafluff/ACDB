Her name comes from the word ova, the Latin word for eggs, which chickens lay. It is also possible that her name comes from the word \"avian\", meaning bird. Her catchphrase, \"beaker\", possibly originates from the word, beak. Ava was absent in Animal Crossing: Wild World and Animal Crossing: City Folk."}
