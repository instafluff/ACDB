His name is a shortening of Limburger cheese, a type of cheese with a strong odor, which may reflect his rough and unshaven appearance. His Japanese name comes from rakkyō, Chinese onion, similarly referencing a strong smell. His catchphrase, squinky, is a combination of the noise a mouse makes, squeak, and the word stinky."}
