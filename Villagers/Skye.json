Her name is derived from her appearance, which resembles the sky and clouds, while her phrase \"airmail\" refers to mail sent through the sky via airplane. Skye shares her Japanese and Korean name \"Lily\" with the frog villager Lily, and her catchphrase in Japan \"fuwawa\" sounds like \"flower\", in reference to her name \"Lily\". \"Fuwafuwa\" is also Japanese for \"fluffy\", much like her cloudy appearance."}
