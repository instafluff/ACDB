His initial phrase, \"mate,\" is a common way for an Australian to refer to a friend. He originally appeared in the original games up to Doubutsu no Mori e+, although he was planned to appear in Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer but was cut. He eventually returned in Animal Crossing: New Leaf - Welcome amiibo as an amiibo card villager."}
