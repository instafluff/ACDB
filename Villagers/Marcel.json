His English name and catchphrase are French, which come from his mime-like appearance. \"Non\" (which means \"no\") is a mild joke on the French way of speaking, since it is stereotypically used at the end of questions (e.g. \"This shovel is used for digging up fossils, non?\"). He is probably named after Marcel Marceau, a known French mime and actor. Despite this, his clothing, house, and Japanese name are traditionally Japanese themed; his face may be intended to resemble a Japanese festival mask."}
