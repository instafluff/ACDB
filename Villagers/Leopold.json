He debuted with a jock personality in Doubutsu no Mori, and did not reappear in the series after Doubutsu no Mori e+ until Animal Crossing: New Leaf - Welcome amiibo, where his personality was changed to smug. His name is probably wordplay on the lion's scientific name, Panthera leo. It could also be a take on the infamous lineage of King Leopolds in Belgium, which would coincide with the \"Kings of the Jungle\" metaphor often associated with lions."}
