In Animal Crossing, she is an islander, whereas from City Folk onwards, she is a villager. Her name is based on the ankh, which is the Egyptian hieroglyphic character that reads \"life.\" Her catchphrase relates to her arrogant \"snooty\" personality, by saying \"me,\" and a sound a cat makes, \"meow.\" Her Japanese catchphrase, Kufufu, is a combination of the Pharaoh Khufu, and ufufu, a Japanese onomatopoeia for laughter. Egyptians worshiped cats, and had a cat god, which may be where the idea for Ankha's design came from."}
