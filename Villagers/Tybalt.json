The name Tybalt is most likely taken from William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, being named after the character of the same name. This is especially considering that another character in the play makes a scene of nicknaming Tybalt the \"King of Cats,\" which in itself is a reference to Tybalt/Tibert the Cat from the story of Reynard the Fox. His Japanese name is the alias of the Japanese bandit Tani Yukata who was active in Malaya, Harimau, which is Malay for \"tiger.\""}
