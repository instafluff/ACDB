Although she was planned to reappear in Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer, Sylvana was cut from the final game. She returns in Animal Crossing: New Leaf's Welcome amiibo Update, however. Sylvana's name is most likely derived from the Latin term 'silva,' which means 'forest.' This coincides with her favorite saying, which references the forest landscape."}
