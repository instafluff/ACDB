Following her debut in Doubutsu no Mori, Candi would appear in every game up until Doubutsu no Mori e+, in which she would remain absent until Animal Crossing: New Leaf - Welcome amiibo. Candi's name is derived from “candy”, a sugary food that many members of her personality, peppy, are known to overeat, making them hyper due to the excess sugar."}
