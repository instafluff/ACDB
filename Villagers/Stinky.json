His name may refer to his appearance which is usually associated with poor hygiene - dark green skin and underwear over his face. His initial phrase may have something to do with wrestling, a sound of strength and power. Stinky is absent in Animal Crossing: Wild World, but reappears in Animal Crossing: City Folk."}
