Her name refers to \"Big Bertha\", a name commonly given to something that is unusually large, much like how hippos are large animals. Her Japanese name refers to red bean paste, also known as anko; this relates to her Japanese favorite saying, \"dango over flowers\", as dango is commonly made with red bean paste. She shares her catchphrase with Zucker, a lazy octopus villager. Not only does her catchphrase relate to hippos tending to splash around in water, but Zucker's catchphrase in Japanese is a synonym for Bertha's in the Kansai dialect."}
