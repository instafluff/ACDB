After being absent from any Animal Crossing series media for over a decade, Weber made a reappearance in Animal Crossing: New Leaf - Welcome amiibo. Additionally, data for Weber was found in Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer, but he was not present in the final game. His name is a play on web, since ducks have webbed feet.  His catchphrase, \"quaa\", is a play on quack, the sound a duck makes.  His Japanese catchphrase, \"piyo,\" is the onomatopoeia for peeping, a sound that young birds make."}
