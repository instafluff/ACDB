His name possibly came from Apollo 11, the first spacecraft launched by the United States to land a man on the moon, and the Apollo Space Program itself. He is also a bald eagle, a symbol of the United States and in the Great Seal, which ties in with his birthday being July 4th - Independence Day. He also appears in 🎬 Gekijōban Doubutsu no Mori as a minor character."}
