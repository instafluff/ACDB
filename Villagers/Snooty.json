They are called snooty villagers because, in earlier games, they often act prideful and dismissive towards the player. However, in newer games such as Animal Crossing: New Leaf and New Horizons, they are depicted as more mature and level-headed. They are usually portrayed wearing makeup and stylish clothing, as well as owning luxurious furniture in their homes, though there are some exceptions. Prior to New Leaf, they were considered the female equivalent to the male cranky villagers, despite neither personality sharing anything in common; they are now considered closer to the more similar smug villagers. There are currently 68 snooty villagers so far, one of which (Violet) previously had a different personality, while two of them (Sylvia and Ursala) are given a different personality in Animal Crossing: New Leaf."}
