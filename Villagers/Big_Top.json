He made his debut appearance in Doubutsu no Mori e+. His name may be a reference to the main arena of a circus, the big top, where elephants are mainly situated in a circus. It may also be a joke on the size of elephants, who are large mammals, or \"big\" in this case. His initial phrase, \"villain\", plays along with his superhero charm and appearance. Some believe he may be a villain to the four other superhero villagers, Kid Cat, Agent S, Rocket, and Filly, with his picture in Animal Crossing: Wild World quote being \"World domination!\" and his phrase could be a tag placed on him to mark him as the evildoer in the game, though it depends on opinion."}
