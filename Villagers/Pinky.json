As a peppy villager, she will be friendly towards the player, making it easy to befriend her. Her name relates to the color of her fur, which is pink, and her initial phrase, \"wah\" is another word for \"what\" which may relate to her character type, due to the fact that peppy villagers like her have a short attention span. The phrase may also relate to how, in Japan, wan is used for the sound that a panda makes. Her Japanese catchphrase, \"wao,\" reflects this. She is one of the villagers to appear on the cover of Animal Crossing, in the lower window on the side."}
