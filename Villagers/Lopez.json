He first appeared in Animal Crossing: New Leaf. His name comes from \"antelopes,\" animals that bear a resemblance to deer. His initial catchphrase is a play on \"buck,\" meaning a male antelope or deer. His Japanese catchphrase is a play on \"gazelle.\" In Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer, he is one of the three mandatory clients in the game, the other two being Goldie and Carrie."}
