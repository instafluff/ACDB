His name is a portmanteau of the onomatopoeia of a frog noise, \"ribbit\", and \"robot.\" He is one of the few villagers in the game who are not technically animals, along with Sprocket, Coco, Stitches, Bow, and Meow. He and Lily switched their catchphrases from Wild World until the Pocket Camp 1.8.1 update."}
