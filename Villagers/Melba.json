Melba's English name may relate to the Australian city of Melbourne, also the Australian opera singer Dame Nelly Melba, who also represents her own ice-cream and Melba toast, which her phrase, \"toasty,\" is a reference to - a dry, crisp, and thinly-sliced piece of toast that originated and is popular in Australia, where koalas are also from. Her Japanese name refers to the Australian city, Adelaide."}
