She first appeared in Animal Crossing: New Leaf. Her name comes from fritas, meaning \"fries\" in Portuguese. Her Japanese name is the same as the English name of Wendy, another sheep villager. Her initial catchphrase, \"oh ewe\", is a pun on \"oh you\", a phrase meant as a reply to a clever or cheeky statement, and \"ewe\", a female sheep."}
