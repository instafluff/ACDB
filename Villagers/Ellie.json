She first appeared in Doubutsu no Mori. Following more than a decade of absence, she made a reappearance in Animal Crossing: New Leaf - Welcome amiibo. Her name comes from the first part of the word elephant. Ellie's catchphrase \"wee one\" is shared with Dotty in Animal Crossing. In Animal Crossing: New Leaf - Welcome amiibo, this was changed to \"li'l one\" to avoid confusion."}
