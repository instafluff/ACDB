Her name comes from the word \"pluck,\" meaning \"to pull out feathers when preparing a bird for food.\" When she debuted in Animal Crossing, she was a peppy islander. After Doubutsu no Mori e+, Plucky would be absent from any Animal Crossing series media until she made an appearance in Animal Crossing: New Leaf - Welcome amiibo, this time as a sisterly villager."}
