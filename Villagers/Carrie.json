After Doubutsu no Mori e+ was released, Carrie would be absent from any Animal Crossing series media until she reappeared in Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer as one of the mandatory clients in the game, alongside Goldie and Lopez. Carrie made her reappearance in a mainline game in the Animal Crossing series in Animal Crossing: New Leaf - Welcome amiibo, followed by another appearance in Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp. Her name may possibly be derived from how female kangaroos carry their joeys. Her initial catchphrase, \"little one\", refers to her joey."}
