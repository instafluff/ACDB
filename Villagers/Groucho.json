He was absent in Animal Crossing: Wild World, but returned to the Animal Crossing series in Animal Crossing: City Folk. His name may come from the word \"grouchy,\" another word used for someone who is \"cranky.\" In real life, a famous Groucho was the middle brother of five, who went on to form The Marx Brothers; another of the brothers' names appears in the Animal Crossing series, named Chico the mouse."}
