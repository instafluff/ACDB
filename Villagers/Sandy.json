After being absent in all Animal Crossing media since Doubutsu no Mori e+, Sandy made a return in Animal Crossing: New Leaf - Welcome amiibo, although she was planned to make a reappearance in Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer, but was cut for unknown reasons. Sandy also appears in Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp. Her English name is likely a reference to the common misconception that ostriches hide their heads in the sand when frightened. Her Japanese name means \"orchid.\""}
