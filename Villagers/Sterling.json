His first appearance was in Animal Crossing: City Folk, followed by Animal Crossing: New Leaf. His name comes from the \"sterling silver,\" which is what his helmet is made out of. It can also be based on \"starling,\" a type of bird. The name may also be a nod to the Sterling Renaissance Festival. His Japanese name is a reference to Ginkaku-ji, also known as the Silver Pavilion."}
