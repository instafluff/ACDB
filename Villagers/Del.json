Del first appeared in Doubutsu no Mori e+, and again in Animal Crossing: City Folk and Animal Crossing: New Leaf. He has a naval theme to his appearance and home, so his English and Japanese names both refer to famous battleships: Del is likely an abbreviation of \"Delaware\", the name of multiple ships in the U. S. Navy, while his Japanese name refers to the Japanese battleship Yamato. His Japanese favorite saying is also similar to Sylvana's English favorite saying in Animal Crossing: New Leaf - Welcome amiibo."}
