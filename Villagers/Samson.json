His catchphrase, \"pipsqueak\", is based on the sound made by mice and the term \"pipsqueak\", which means \"little\". His Japanese catchphrase, \"chū\", is based on the Japanese onomatopoeia for a mouse's squeaking, \"chūchū\" (ちゅうちゅう).  His favorite saying in Animal Crossing: New Leaf is a pun on Theodore Roosevelt's famous quote \"Speak softly and carry a big stick.\", meaning to always be wary of your neighbors."}
