She was planned to reappear in Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer, but was cut from the game, though she returns in Animal Crossing: New Leaf's Welcome amiibo update, now as a sisterly villager. Her name comes from the Latin and Portuguese word \"ursa,\" which means \"bear,\" and female name, \"Ursula.\""}
