He has a jock personality, which means he will appear competitive towards the player. His name could refer to two things. \"Genji\" means a \"military geek\" in Japanese, and \"Genji\" is also the titular character in The Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu, which is often considered to be the world's first novel. His initial phrase, \"mochi\", is a type of Japanese rice cake made with rice flour pounded into paste; Genji himself somewhat resembles mochi. His phrase prior to New Horizons was \"otaku\", which means, in Japanese, someone with an obsessive personality, reflecting on the jock villagers' fitness and health obsession; alternatively, it functions as a formal second-person pronoun, translating to \"your house\". He is best friends with Aziz, according to his e-Card bio."}
