As a jock villager, he will appear friendly and competitive when around the player. His name may refer to a vaulting horse used in gymnastics - which also gets the name from a type of horse sport where a rider tries to stay on top of a horse while it is \"bucking.\" His initial phrase is a play on the word \"partner\", which is pronounced \"pardner\" by cowboys."}
