She first appeared in Animal Crossing: New Leaf. Her name is from the Bible and means \"pleasant\"; it also can mean \"honest and beautiful\" in Japanese, referencing how snooty villagers like looking beautiful. Her catchphrase, \"moolah,\" is a play on the slang word \"moola,\" meaning \"money.\" It is also similar to the catchphrase of Petunia, another snooty cow villager."}
