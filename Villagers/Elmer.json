He appears in all games from the Animal Crossing series. His name could be a reference to either  the Elmer Horse Collection, a company which makes horse figurines, or Elmer's Glue (glue used to be made from horses). His initial phrase, \"tenderfoot\", may relate to the cowboy ranch rank, where a tenderfoot is an inexperienced ranchman, or \"cowboy\". This may also be related to one of the Boy Scout ranks in American Scouts. His picture quote is referring to his lazy personality, because lazy villagers enjoy the consumption of food. He shares his picture quote with Drake, another villager."}
