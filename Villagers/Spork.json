First appearing in Doubutsu no Mori, he was absent from Animal Crossing: Wild World, but reappeared in Animal Crossing: City Folk onward. His US name is a play on the word \"pork\", the meat of a pig. In addition, a spork is an eating utensil, which could reflect his love of eating as a lazy villager. His PAL name, \"Crackle,\" refers to \"crackling,\" another kind of pig meat. His Japanese name, \"Polk,\" is a pun on \"Pork,\" which is a homophone of \"Polk\" in Japanese. His initial phrase, \"snork,\" is a combination of his name and the name given to the noise pigs make, \"snort\"."}
