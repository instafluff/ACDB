He first appeared in Animal Crossing: New Leaf. His name may refer to the shell of a chestnut, the nut of which he bears a resemblance to. His Japanese name is a combination of kuri, \"chestnut,\" and risu, \"squirrel.\" His initial catchphrase, \"cardio,\" refers to aerobic exercise, reflecting his jock personality. His Japanese catchphrase, like his name, is a reference to chestnuts."}
