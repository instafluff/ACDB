She first appeared in Animal Crossing: New Leaf. Her English name may come from the way her headpiece connects like a band to her horns, making it look like she is wearing earmuffs. Her Japanese name, Frill, references her Gothic Lolita style. Her catchphrase, \"nightshade,\" refers to her black wool and the nightshade family of plants."}
