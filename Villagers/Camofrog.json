His name relates to his appearance—a frog with a camouflage pattern as his skin. His initial phrase, \"ten-hut\", is a United States Army term meaning \"Come to attention\"; this also relates to his appearance, as camouflage is frequently used in army uniforms. His favorite sayings, \"You can't see me,\" and \"What you can't see can't hurt you,\" also come from his camouflaged appearance."}
