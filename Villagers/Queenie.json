Her name does not directly link to her species or personality, but it can be said that snooty villagers see themselves as high up in the hierarchy, seeing themselves as royalty. Her name may also be a reference to Queensland in Australia, where emus, a similar animal to ostriches, can be found. Her initial phrase, \"chicken,\" is a joke on her species, a chick being a member of the bird group as is her species, the ostrich. She is the only ostrich to appear in every game in the series."}
