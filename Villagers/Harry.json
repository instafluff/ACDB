He first appeared in Doubutsu no Mori e+ as an islander under the jock personality, then later reappeared in Animal Crossing: City Folk as a cranky villager, after being absent in Animal Crossing: Wild World. He, alongside Violet, is the second villager to have his personality changed. His name may be a play on the word \"hairy,\" which refers to his beard. His initial phrase, \"beach bum,\" possibly references the fact that he was an islander in e+."}
