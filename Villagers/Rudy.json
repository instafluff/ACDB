He first appeared in Animal Crossing: New Leaf. His English name may be a reference to Rudolph, a famous reindeer, who has a red nose like Rudy. His birthday, which is close to Christmas, wherein the iconic Christmas figure Santa Claus uses reindeer as a method of transportation, supports this theory. He shares his birthday with Isabelle and Digby. His picture quote is a reference to the popular phrase \"cats always land on their feet.\""}
