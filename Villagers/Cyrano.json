He is named after Cyrano de Bergerac, a French dramatist and duelist known, among other things, for his large nose. Cyrano's portrait quote may be a reference to a statue of his namesake in Bergerac, Dordogne, a commune in southern France. He appeared in 🎬 Gekijōban Doubutsu no Mori as a minor character, being friends with Cesar, the gorilla."}
