She may be named after an aurora, a natural phenomenon which can be seen in high latitude regions of the Earth's sky, including the South Pole where most species of penguin live. While her Animal Crossing e-card suggests that her initial phrase comes from pronouncing \"baby\" while stuttering, given the fact that penguins are often associated with arctic climates, the pronunciation may suggest she is shivering instead. She has appeared in every Animal Crossing game to date."}
