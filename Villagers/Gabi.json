Her Japanese name is from a Russian style of stove used for cooking and home heating. Her catchphrase relates to her species, \"bun\" being a shortening of \"bunny.\" She appears on the cover of Animal Crossing: amiibo Festival, standing in front of the Town Tree, where she is hosting the Board Game mode. In Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer, her request is \"A room with a piano,\" which is a reference to the composer and pianist Ludwig van Beethoven, who shares a birthday with Gabi. Her name is also the Japanese name of a cranky cub villager."}
