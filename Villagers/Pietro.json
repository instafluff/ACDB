He first appeared in Animal Crossing: New Leaf. His name is derived from \"pied,\" which means having a bright and multicolored patchwork appearance, referencing the color of his wool, or from \"Pierrot\" referencing his clown-like appearance. Similarly, his initial catchphrase is \"honk honk,\" a common noise associated with clowns as they squeeze their bulbous nose to make noise. His Japanese catchphrase, gufufu, is a Japanese onomatopoeia for laughter."}
