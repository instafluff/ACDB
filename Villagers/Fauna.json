She is a new character in Animal Crossing: New Leaf and is one of the first villagers announced for the release of the game. Her name is a pun on 'fawn', meaning a young deer, and 'fauna', a term used for animals of a specific time or place. More specifically, it may be a reference to mythical fauns, which are half-goat, half human creatures in Roman mythology heavily associated with 'wildness'. Her initial catchphrase is a pun on \"deer\". Similarly, her Japanese catchphrase is a pun on desu ka, a question sentence ending, and shika, meaning deer."}
