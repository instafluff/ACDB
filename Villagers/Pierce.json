His name may relate to either his beak or his talons, which can pierce through the flesh of other animals in reality. His initial phrases relate to the bird species. His name and initial phrase may be a reference to the character Benjamin \"Hawkeye\" Pierce from the TV series \"M*A*S*H\", although this may be a coincidence."}
