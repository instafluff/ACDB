Considering she looks like a race horse, her name may simply relate to \"victory\". It could also come from the Victoria Derby, or the famous racehorse Victoria Park. Her Japanese name has been the name of several racehorses, as well as sounding similar to \"centaur.\" Her initial phrase relates to sugar cubes being given to horses as a treat. This catchphrase is very similar to Cleo's catchphrase."}
