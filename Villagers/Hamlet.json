He first appears in Animal Crossing: New Leaf. His name refers to his appearance as a small hamster, and is named after the Shakespeare character of the same name. His picture quote is an allusion to Prince Hamlet's quote, \"The play's the thing.\" Hamlet's Japanese name is a portmanteau of \"Hamster\" and -suke, a common Japanese boys' name suffix."}
