Her English name may originate from Audrey Buchanan, an 87-year-old grandmother of the game designer Paul Hubans with 3,500+ hours in Animal Crossing: New Leaf, and called her player character Audie.[1] While this may be the case, her name very much sounds like the word audio, referencing her aspirations to become a popstar as well as her loud personality."}
