She first appeared in Doubutsu no Mori e+ as an islander, before returning in Animal Crossing: New Leaf - Welcome amiibo after nearly a decade of absence, this time as a villager, followed by an appearance in Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp. Julia's name could possibly be derived from \"Jewel\" or \"Jewelry,\" both being things that relate to her snooty personality's elegant stereotype. Her initial catchphrase is the phrase \"darling\" with an English or Australian affectation, the former of which are stereotypically known to be refined, reserved, but sometimes condescending, again relating to the snooty personality. It is similar to the catchphrase of Baabara, another snooty villager."}
