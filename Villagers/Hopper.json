In Japanese, however, Hopper is likely named after Bodhidharma, better known in Japan as \"Daruma,\" the founder of Zen Buddhism and the inspiration for the Daruma Dolls. In addition to appearing in every game of the series (with the exception of Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp), Hopper also appears in 🎬 Gekijōban Doubutsu no Mori with a minor role."}
