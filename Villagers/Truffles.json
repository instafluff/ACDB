Her name is a reference to the edible fungus called truffles, a food that is common in a pig's diet and found hidden underground.  Her Japanese name, Tonko, may be short for Tonkotsu, a dish made with pork belly and bones, simmered with miso, sake and vegetables.  It is also a type of Ramen. Alternatively, it could be from ton, \"pork,\" and ko, a Japanese girls' name suffix. Her catchphrase, \"snoutie\", may relate to her snout."}
