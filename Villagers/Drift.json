In Animal Crossing, he appeared as an islander. His name may come from his original role as an islander, as the word \"drift\" is usually used in the context of water. His catchphrase used in Animal Crossing through Animal Crossing: New Leaf comes from the sound a frog makes combined with \"bro\", a term that jocks commonly use in conversations. His English catchphrase as of Animal Crossing: New Horizons is onomatopoeia of a frog noise, \"ribbit\", combined with the word \"drip\", again evoking the water theme from his name. His Japanese catchphrase is the sound of a frog's croaking in Japanese."}
