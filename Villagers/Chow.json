He has appeared in every game so far, with the exception of Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp. Chow's name comes from the spelling variation of the Chinese surname, Zhou - the fact that it is a Chinese (sur)name relates to Chow being a Panda Bear, which are native to China. In the city of Hull, England, \"chow\" is a colloquialism used for \"telling off.\" As people are usually cranky when telling someone off, this relates to Chow's personality, although this is most likely a coincidence."}
