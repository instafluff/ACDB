She later re-appeared in Animal Crossing: Wild World, Animal Crossing: City Folk, and Animal Crossing: New Leaf where she is a villager. She probably is named after marinas, which are sheltered harbors where boats are kept in the water. Her Japanese name, Takorina, has \"tako\" in it, which means octopus in Japanese. Her initial catchphrase is a reference to the onomatopoeia of an octopus squirting ink."}
