He did not appear in Animal Crossing: Wild World, but reappeared in Animal Crossing: City Folk. His name comes from the fang, a tooth found in carnivores.  It may also be a reference to the 1906 Jack London novel White Fang. His Japanese name is named after Siberia, a region in northern Asia that is mostly an arctic environment."}
