After being absent from Animal Crossing: Wild World and Animal Crossing: City Folk, he reappeared in Animal Crossing: New Leaf as a cranky villager. He is named after the steak cuts of beef, t-bones. His catchphrase is a pun; a moocher is someone who asks by begging, while mooing is a bovine's onomatopoeia. His picture quote is a reference to one of Bart Simpson's catchphrases, \"Don't have a cow, man!\""}
