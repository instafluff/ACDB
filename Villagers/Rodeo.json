His name, Rodeo, comes from rodeo bulls, or bull-riding at rodeos, an event usually taking place in the US, where the rider aims to stay on the bull the longest while it is jumping and running. His initial phrase, \"chaps,\" also relates to this. Chaps are an item of clothing, typically worn over jeans and made out of leather, which protect a rider from their trousers rubbing against their legs, otherwise causing irritation."}
