She is named after her color and species, and also the fruit, the blueberry (which relates to her catchphrase, \"peach\"). Her Japanese name may come from nuigurumi, meaning a stuffed toy. Bluebear also shares her Japanese catchphrase with Megumi, a peppy dog villager from Doubutsu no Mori e+, though Bluebear's is spelled in katakana, while Megumi's is in hiragana."}
