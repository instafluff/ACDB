Greta's design is based on the otafuku, a type of Japanese mask. Her name was originally a derivation of the female given name Margareta, becoming later a proper name and thus maintaining its meaning, \"pearl\" - befitting the trend to associate snooty villagers with rare gems or glamorous things."}
