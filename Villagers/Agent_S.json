Like the other superheroes, she was introduced in Doubutsu no Mori e+, and then reappeared in Animal Crossing: Wild World, Animal Crossing: City Folk, and Animal Crossing: New Leaf. She is one of only three superheroines (the others being Rocket and Filly), and the only one to appear in games before Animal Crossing: New Leaf. She may be Kid Cat's sidekick, because of her initial phrase \"sidekick\" and their Japanese names (Kid Cat's Japanese name is #1 while Agent S's Japanese name is #2)."}
