Boots's name is derived from boots as footwear, because they can be made from tough alligator hide. His catchphrase, munchie, relates to \"munching\", an onomatopoeia for a chomping sound. Although not popular in his original Japanese origin, Boots's offbeat expressions and jock personality make him extremely popular to western gamers. Nintendo of America localizer Bill Trinen has also cited Boots as one of his most memorable villagers."}
