He strikingly resembles a yeti, which is made more apparent by his phrase and name. His initial phrase \"groovy\" is possibly a pun relating to being cool. The name Hans is a popular masculine name in Scandinavian countries, places characterized by cold temperatures and mountains. Sunairu likely derives from スノー sunō (snow) and ゴリラ gorira (gorilla). His favorite saying is similar to that of Rosie, except \"purr\" is replaced by \"turn.\""}
