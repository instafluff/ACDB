She has appeared in every Animal Crossing game to date. Her name is a reference to lily pads, a kind of plant that frogs are stereotypically known to occupy while in water. Her Animal Crossing: Wild World, Animal Crossing: City Folk phrase is a reference to the sound a frog is described to make. Her catchphrase was swapped with Ribbot until the 1.8.1 update for Pocket Camp, in which Lily reverts to her original catchphrase from Animal Crossing."}
