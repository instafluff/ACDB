Bea's name is likely derived from \"Beagle\", a breed of dog, while her catchphrase refers to Bingo, a popular children's song involving a dog of that name. It is also the name of a matching game commonly played by elders. Bea's Japanese name may refer to her fur color, which is colored similarly to a bagel."}
