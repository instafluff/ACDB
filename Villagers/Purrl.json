Calicoes have a myth of being a lucky type of cat, so Purrl can be suited as her name. Her name sounds similar to both the noise that a cat makes, \"purr,\" and a gemstone prized for its elegance and shine, \"pearl,\" referring to her \"shiny and refined\"-based personality. Her favorite saying, \"let them drink cream,\" is a reference to “Let them eat cake”, a famous quote uttered by French noble-lady Marie Antoinette, although historical records have proven this to have never been said by her specifically."}
