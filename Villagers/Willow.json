She first appeared in Doubutsu no Mori e+ as one of six starter cards bundled with the game, alongside Walker, Maggie, Rod, Merry, and Angus, respectively. Although she is absent in Animal Crossing: Wild World, she later reappears in Animal Crossing: City Folk, her debut in a game released to the west. Willow's name may be derived from the golden willow, a variant of the white willow, referring to her golden wool. Her catchphrase comes from the nursery rhyme Little Bo Peep."}
