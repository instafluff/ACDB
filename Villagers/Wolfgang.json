His name is derived from the famous composer, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and from his species. His Japanese name, Lobo, is Spanish for wolf; it also is the English name for another wolf. He appears on the album covers of K. K. Waltz and K.K. Adventure. His initial catchphrase refers to snarling, the sound a wolf makes when it is angry, fitting both his species and his personality."}
