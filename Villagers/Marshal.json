He first appeared in Animal Crossing: New Leaf. His name is probably a reference to his marshmallow-like appearance, as well as being a common, male given name. His initial phrase, \"sulky,\" may bear some resemblance to his appearance. As of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, he is the only smug squirrel in the Animal Crossing series."}
