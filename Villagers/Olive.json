After Doubutsu no Mori e+, Olive would remain absent in the series until her return in Animal Crossing: New Leaf - Welcome amiibo, alongside Murphy. Her name is derived from the fruit of the same name, the olive, which are known to be sweet when eaten, referring to her normal personality (Normal villagers are occasionally referred to as \"sweet\" villagers instead of normal.) Olive's fur color is also similar in color to her namesake."}
