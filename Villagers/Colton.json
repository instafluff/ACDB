He first appeared in Animal Crossing: New Leaf. His name Colton derives from the young male horse, a colt. His catchphrase likely refers to both his smug personality and the act of \"checking\" opponents in chess. His noble theming and knightly pose in his New Leaf render give him a knight motif, referencing the white horse-shaped knight piece in chess."}
