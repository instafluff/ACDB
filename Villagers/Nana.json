She debuted in Animal Crossing: Wild World. Her name comes from \"banana\". It may also reference a character from Ice Climber, further evidenced by her catchphrase, \"po po\" - Popo being another character from the same game. Her Japanese name may be a reference to Monchhichi, a brand of dolls resembling monkeys. She appears on the Animal Crossing: City Folk official poster. Her Animal Crossing: Wild World picture quote is the same as Flora's in Animal Crossing: New Leaf, but Flora's quote ends with a period instead of an exclamation point."}
