Her name is derived from her fur color. She originally appeared in Doubutsu no Mori e+ as islander under the peppy personality, and after being absent in Animal Crossing: Wild World, she returns in Animal Crossing: City Folk, now as a snooty villager. This makes her, alongside Harry, the second villager to have her personality changed between games, the first being Rowan."}
