His localized name in several languages, along with him wearing the Lil Bro's Shirt prior to Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer, seems be a reference to Luigi from the Super Mario series. His catchphrase, \"toots\", was changed to \"odelay\" in Happy Home Designer, and to \"hoo hoo ha\" in New Horizons. In Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer, Louie was released as DLC on September 26th, 2015, where the player could get him at Nintendo Zones in celebration of the Super Mario series' anniversary, and from October 6th, 2015, Nintendo distributed him through SpotPass."}
