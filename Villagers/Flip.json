He first appeared in Animal Crossing: New Leaf, where he  replaces Champ who was originally intended to appear. Flip's name is likely a reference to a monkey's behavior: some monkeys are known to flip in the air while climbing in trees, and his picture quote is a reference to \"see no evil, hear no evil, say no evil\", otherwise known as the \"three evils\" that is typically represented by three monkeys. His Japanese name refers to Sarutobi Sasuke, a famous fictional ninja whose surname Sarutobi means \"monkey jump\"."}
