As a cranky villager, he will appear grouchy and mean towards the player, but will slowly begin to warm up and befriend them.  His name may relate to his species, which live in packs lead by an alpha male, sometimes called a \"chief\". His initial phrase, \"harrumph\", is a sign of boredom or annoyance, often related to cranky villagers."}
