He appeared first in Animal Crossing: New Leaf. His name might come from the Spanish word \"Olé!\", an exclamation mostly heard in flamenco dancing and bullfighting, which also reflects his Spanish appearance, but could also be derived from \"olfactory\", pertaining to sense of smell. His Japanese initial catchphrase is Spanish for \"much\" or \"many.\""}
