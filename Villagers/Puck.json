His name refers to a \"puck,\" used in hockey games, which is played on ice, and ice is the habitat the typical penguin lives in. His Japanese name is literally the word Hockey. Due to his appearance as a hockey player, many players could mistake him for a jock villager. His favorite saying, \"A bad attitude will land you in the penalty box,\" also references hockey. He is absent in Animal Crossing: Wild World, and he returns in Animal Crossing: City Folk. His initial phrase, brrrrrrrrr, is what people say when they are cold."}
