After appearing in Doubutsu no Mori e+, Maddie remained absent until her return in Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer, followed by an appearance in the Animal Crossing: New Leaf : Welcome amiibo update by scanning her amiibo card and visiting her at the Campground. Maddie's Japanese name, Marron, is the name of a chestnut dessert that is colored brown, referencing the color of her fur. It also sounds similar to a dog's howl. Her catchphrase, \"yippee,\" is derived from \"yip,\" an English onomatopoeia for a dog sound. \"Yippee\" as a stand-alone word is also an exclamation to convey excitement, referencing the nature of her peppy personality, which are depicted as energetic and overly excited. Her Japanese catchphrase, wantsū, comes from wan-wan, a Japanese onomatopoeia for a dog's bark, and wan tsū, the Japanese pronunciation of the English words, \"one two.\""}
