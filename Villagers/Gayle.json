She first appeared in Animal Crossing: New Leaf. Her name may derive from \"scale\", a jagged area of skin typically seen on reptiles including alligators, or it may simply be from \"gator\". Her Japanese name is the word \"alligator\" combined with \"Betty\". It also sounds similar to \"arigatou,\" Japanese for \"thank you,\" reflecting Gayle's normal personality, which are often seen to be overly grateful."}
