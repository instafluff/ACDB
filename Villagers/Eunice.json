She first appeared in Animal Crossing, but was absent in Animal Crossing: Wild World. She returned to the Animal Crossing series in Animal Crossing: City Folk. Her name is derived from \"ewe,\" a word used to refer to a female sheep. Her Japanese name comes from Mohair, a specific type of fabric made from Angora goat hair.  Her catchphrase comes from the byproduct of young sheep, a lamb, called a lamb chop."}
