His English name is derived from the species of bird of the same name, although there are no jays that have red heads like the villager. His Japanese name is the katakana writing of the kanji 燕 (Tsubakuro), \"Swallow\" (the species of bird). Also, his forked tail, red head, blue body, and white belly also suggests a barn swallow or a wire-tailed swallow. His Japanese name is also derived from \"comfort\" or \"enjoy\"."}
