His name is a portmanteau of \"egg\", what his species lays, and the name \"Bert\", a nickname of \"Robert\". His Japanese name can mean \"chilblains\" or \"frostbite\". Egbert's favorite saying in Animal Crossing: New Leaf, which is \"You gotta break a few eggs to make an omelet,\" means that you cannot have success without loss."}
