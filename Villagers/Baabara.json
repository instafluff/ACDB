Her name is a play on words of the name 'Barbara', and the sound sheep make, which is \"baa\". Combining the two makes \"Baabara\". Her initial phrase, \"daahling\", is also a joke on the noise sheep make, and the word \"darling\". Her Japanese initial phrase, andu, is the Japanese pronunciation of the French words un and duex, meaning \"one\" and \"two,\" which is a play on her Japanese name, Trois, the French word for \"three.\""}
