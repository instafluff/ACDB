His name relates to the myth that frogs—more commonly toads—have warts and pass them through contact. His name may also be a reference to Wart, a frog character in the Mario series, which is referenced to throughout the Animal Crossing franchise. His initial phrase, \"grr-ribbit,\" is onomatopoeia for a noise a frog makes combined with \"grr,\" referencing his cranky personality."}
