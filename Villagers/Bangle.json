She first appeared in Animal Crossing, but was absent from Animal Crossing: Wild World and Animal Crossing: City Folk, not reappearing until Animal Crossing: New Leaf. Her name comes from the Bengal tiger, a subspecies of Tiger commonly native to India and southern Asia. Bangle was also the only female tiger in the Animal Crossing series, prior to when New Leaf introduced Bianca and Claudia."}
