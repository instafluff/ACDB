She has a few darker patches of beige on her muzzle, paws, feet, tail, and ears, as well as a beige spot on her left eye, of which her eyes are a slim, oblong shape colored into a chocolate brown with cream pupils. Her picture quote in Animal Crossing: Wild World, which mentions a Labrador, may imply that Goldie herself is a Labrador. Her name comes from the dog species, \"golden retriever\" by taking the name \"golden\" and turning it into a name, \"Goldie\"."}
