Like other villagers from this game, he also appears in Animal Crossing: New Leaf - Welcome amiibo as one of the first new characters unveiled. Hopkins' name is derived from \"hopping\", a common behavior of rabbits, while his catchphrase is a reference to the Bambi character of the same name, who is also a rabbit."}
