She is absent in the Animal Crossing series until Animal Crossing: New Leaf's Welcome amiibo update, in which she can be moved into the player's town via her amiibo card. Her name comes from tomato ketchup (tomato sauce), a condiment used oftentimes on sandwiches. This also refers to her appearance, which resembles a tomato. Her English initial phrase is also the name of a snooty hippo villager."}
