Her name is a reference to either the poppy, a red flower, or poppy seeds, which are commonly used to make sweets and pastries. Her Japanese name is a reference to gummy candies, being the German-origin name for them in Japanese. Her catchphrase is a reference to one of squirrels' favorite foods, nuts. Poppy is one of the four normal villagers introduced in Animal Crossing: City Folk, alongside Gala, Bettina and Pekoe."}
