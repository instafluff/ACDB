He appeared on the cover of Animal Crossing, in the background, appearing to be walking up to the house. He also appears on the cover of Animal Crossing: City Folk, appearing to be holding a fishing rod with a black bass. His name comes from the name of the duck's beak, a bill. He shares the same catchphrase with Drake, another duck villager."}
