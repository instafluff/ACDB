His name may come from the word \"punchy,\" which means being groggy or dazed from a series of punches. His catchphrase is the sound of shrugging combined with sighing, which relates to his lazy personality. His picture quote from Animal Crossing: Wild World also relates to his personality, known for being laid back. Punchy was featured on the cover of Animal Crossing, in the upper window on the side with Mitzi, another cat villager."}
