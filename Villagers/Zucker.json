He first appeared in Animal Crossing: New Leaf and was one of the first new villagers announced for that game. His English name comes from ‘sucker,’ like those found on an octopus's tentacles, while his Japanese name and overall appearance refer to takoyaki, a popular Japanese food made with octopus. Zucker shares his catchphrase with Bertha, a normal hippo villager. His Japanese catchphrase is the Kansai dialect (which is spoken in Osaka, a prefecture known for takoyaki)'s equivalent to \"そうです\", Bertha's Japanese catchphrase."}
