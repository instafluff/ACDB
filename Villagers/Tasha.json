She made her debut in Doubutsu no Mori e+, which would be her only appearance in any Animal Crossing series media until she made a reappearance in Animal Crossing: New Leaf - Welcome amiibo. This was later followed by an appearance in Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp, as one of several villagers unlockable through Blathers's Treasure Trek."}
