She reappears in Animal Crossing: Wild World, Animal Crossing: City Folk, and Animal Crossing: New Leaf, where she is a villager. Her name, \"Maelle\", is French for \"ambitious\", a trait known among snooty villagers who wish to become famous or rich. Her Japanese name is also French, being the French pronunciation of \"Anne.\" Her initial phrase, \"duckling\", reflects on her species. Her picture quote from Animal Crossing: Wild World may be a reference to when she was an islander."}
