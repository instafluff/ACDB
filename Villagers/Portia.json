She is also the only dog in the series that has a snooty personality. \"Portia\" is a common English name for individuals of high class, which references her snooty attitude. Her phrase, \"ruffian\" is a pun on \"ruff,\" an onomatopoeia for the noise a dog makes, and a ruffian, a person who appears untidy."}
