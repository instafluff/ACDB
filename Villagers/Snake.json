His name is an anagram of \"sneak,\" reflecting his ninja-like appearance, though it may also be a reference to Solid Snake. His Japanese name likely comes from Momochi Tamba, a legendary ninja who founded the Iga school of ninjutsu. As the first two syllables of his Japanese name, momo also mean peach in Japanese, he could be intentionally designed to be partly pink. Snake's catch phrase in English might be a reference to both his species and his name. The phrase \"bunyip\" is a play on \"bunny,\" and is also the name of a monster sometimes depicted with serpent-like characteristics in Australian Aboriginal mythology."}
