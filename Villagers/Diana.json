She first appeared in Animal Crossing: New Leaf. Her English name refers to the mythical Diana, the Goddess of the Hunt, who transformed a huntsman into a deer when he glimpsed her bathing in the woods; in reference to this, her home is themed after a bathhouse. Her catchphrase \"no doy\" is a term used to label something as common knowledge in an informal conversation, relating to her snooty personality. \"Doy\" also sounds similar to \"doe\", a name for a female deer."}
