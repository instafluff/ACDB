The prefix of his name, \"octa-,\" means eight, which is a reference to his species, which possess eight tentacles. His name is also a reference to Octavian (a.k.a. Augustus), the first emperor of ancient Rome. His Japanese is also prefixed with \"octa-,\" and is derived from \"tarou,\" which is a Japanese boys' name suffix. He is most notable for being the only octopus until Doubutsu no Mori e+, where Marina, a normal villager, appears as an islander. In Animal Crossing: New Leaf and Welcome amiibo, Octavian is also joined by Zucker and Inkwell, respectively."}
